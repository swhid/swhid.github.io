We are excited to announce that we have now released the SWHID Approved Specification, version 1.1, congratulations!

As a consequence, the following updates have been made to the official SWHID website and the development repository:
- The release of the frozen sources of this approved specification is available as [tag v1.1](https://github.com/swhid/specification/releases/tag/v1.1)
- A branch named [v1.1](https://github.com/swhid/specification/tree/v1.1) has been created in the repository: it will allow us to update the v1.1 with minor changes if needed
- The link to the specification from [SWHID.org](https://swhid.org) now points to the released [version v1.1](https://www.swhid.org/specification/v1.1/)
- The version selector available on the top left of the specification page, has been updated: we have "v1.1" as the default, as well as "v1.0" for the first approved specification and "dev" that is currently identical to v1.1, as we just released v1.1
We believe we are now ready to move to the next step, which is the preparation of the submission to ISO of v1.1 in order to become a standard.
