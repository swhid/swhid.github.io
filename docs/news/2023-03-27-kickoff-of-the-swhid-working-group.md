On **March 27, 2023**, the SWHID working group kicked off its work on the publicly available specification of the SWHID.
We move away from the legacy terminology "Software Heritage Identifier" to the new one "Software Hash Identifier", to
underline that this specification does not depend on Software Heritage, even if Software Heritage has been the first
adopter.

A dedicated webinar has been held to help onboarding participants to this working group. The material is available online, and newcomers are encouraged to start here:
