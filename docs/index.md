# SWHID: International Standard for Software Artifact Identification

SWHIDs (from "SoftWare Hash IDentifiers") are persistent, intrinsic identifiers for software source code artifacts such as source code files, source trees, commits, and other objects typically found in version control systems.

## What are SWHIDs?

**SWHIDs** (SoftWare Hash IDentifiers) are persistent, intrinsic identifiers for software source code artifacts such as source code files, source trees, commits, and other objects typically found in version control systems.                 

### Key Benefits

- **Cryptographic Integrity**: Based on Merkle DAGs for tamper-proof identification
- **Decentralized**: No central registry required - anyone can verify identifiers
- **Comprehensive**: Covers files, directories, commits, releases, and snapshots
- **Provenance**: Enables complete traceability of software artifacts
- **Fast**: Efficient computation and verification algorithms

## The SWHID Working Group

The SWHID Working Group oversees development of the SWHID materials in the [SWHID GitHub repositories](https://github.com/swhid), including:                    

- **The SWHID specification** - The official technical standard
- **Software libraries and tools** - Reference implementations and utilities
- **Documentation and resources** - Examples, guides, and adoption stories

## Participation and Governance

Participation in the elaboration of the SWHID standard is open to all. Design and planning are primarily done via the team [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/swhid-discuss) (see [how to join][howto-join]) and regular meetings.

The SWHID specification is maintained by the [SWHID core team](coreteam.md) and follows the principles stated in [the governance document](swhid-governance/index.md) maintained in the [governance repository](https://github.com/swhid/governance/). 

These principles follow the model proposed by the [Community Specification](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification), developed via the [Joint Development Foundation](http://www.jointdevelopment.org) (now part of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)), with inspiration from the [Open Web Foundation agreements](http://openwebfoundation.org) and the [Alliance for Open Media Patent License 1.0](http://aomedia.org/license/patent-license/).                                                                            

## Getting Started
