# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is SWHID?

SWHID (Software Heritage Identifier) is a universal, persistent, and decentralized identifier for software artifacts. It provides a standardized way to identify and reference software components across different platforms and contexts.

## How does SWHID work?

SWHID uses a hierarchical structure that includes:
- **Type identifier**: Specifies the type of software artifact (e.g., `cnt` for content, `dir` for directory)
- **Hash**: A cryptographic hash of the artifact content
- **Additional metadata**: Optional information about the artifact

## What types of software artifacts can SWHID identify?

SWHID can identify:
- Source code repositories and individual commits
- Releases and tags of software projects
- Individual files and directories
- Binary artifacts and packages

## Is SWHID persistent?

Yes, SWHID identifiers are designed to be persistent. They remain valid even if the original source changes, moves, or becomes unavailable.

## How do I get a SWHID for my software?

SWHIDs are generated automatically when software artifacts are archived in Software Heritage. You can also generate SWHIDs using the SWHID tools and libraries.

## Can I use SWHID in my research?

Absolutely! SWHID is designed to enable reliable citation and referencing of software in academic and research contexts.
